vegan.sh

Given command: 
vegan git@github.com:CalderaWP/Caldera-Forms.git [<single composer command>]

It should do

git clone git@github.com:CalderaWP/Caldera-Forms.git

cd Caldera-Forms

Check if npm is installed globally before using npm cli

check if /composer.json exists, else exit

check if package.json exits, else exit

Check if composer is installed globally before using composer cli

composer install - gives an option to add a command argument

npm install


if you give it an address like this "https://gitlab.com/dwayne/vegan" it still works
